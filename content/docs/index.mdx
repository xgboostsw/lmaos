# Machine Learning Labs

This section contains comprehensive machine learning laboratory exercises that cover fundamental algorithms and techniques. Each lab includes practical implementations using scikit-learn and other Python libraries.

## Labs Overview

- **Lab 02**: Linear Regression - Simple, multivariate, and polynomial models
- **Lab 03**: Logistic Regression - Binary classification with Iris dataset
- **Lab 04**: Naive Bayes - Weather-based prediction
- **Lab 05**: Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Breast cancer classification
- **Lab 06**: Decision Trees & Random Forest - Iris classification
- **Lab 07**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Handwritten digit recognition
- **Lab 08**: K-Means Clustering - Customer segmentation
- **Lab 09**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Dimensionality reduction
- **Lab 10**: Ensemble Methods - AdaBoost & XGBoost

Each lab includes complete code examples and can be opened directly in Google Colab for interactive learning.
